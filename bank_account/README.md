# Python Bank Project ‚Äì OOP

This project is an exercise in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python**, simulating the basic functionality of a bank account.  
It was developed to practice fundamental OOP concepts and demonstrate my progress as a beginner programmer.

## üè¶ About the Project

The main component of this project is the **`Bank` class**, which includes:  
- **Public attributes:** `name` and `account_number`.  
- **Private attribute:** `balance`, protected to maintain data integrity.  
- **Methods:**  
  - `deposit_value(amount)`: adds positive amounts to the balance.  
  - Getter and Setter for `balance`: allows controlled access and modification of the private balance.  
  - `show_info()`: displays account information and the updated balance.  

## ‚úÖ Applied Concepts

- Classes and objects  
- Public and private attributes (encapsulation)  
- Getters and setters with validation  
- Instance methods  
- Data validation (preventing negative balances and invalid deposits)
