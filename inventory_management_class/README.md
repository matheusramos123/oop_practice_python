# 🧾 Product Class in Python

This project implements a simple `Product` class developed in **Python**, designed to simulate basic inventory control operations such as **purchasing, restocking, and calculating total stock value**.  

It demonstrates key **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, including encapsulation, property usage, and input validation.

---

## 🚀 Features

The `Product` class provides the following capabilities:

- ✅ **Register products** with name, price, and initial quantity.  
- 🛒 **Purchase products**, decreasing the available stock.  
- 📦 **Restock products**, increasing the quantity in stock.  
- 💰 **Calculate total inventory value** (`price × quantity`).  
- ⚙️ **Control attribute access** using properties (`@property` and `@setter`).

---

## 🧠 Applied Concepts

- **Encapsulation:** use of private attributes (`__price` and `__quantity`)  
- **Properties (Getters and Setters):** controlled access and validation  
- **Instance Methods:** implementing business logic  
- **OOP Best Practices:** organization, readability, and maintainability
