# Python OOP Projects

This repository contains a collection of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercises in Python**, showcasing my learning journey and progression in OOP concepts.

## üèÜ Practiced and Future Concepts

### Already implemented:
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors (`__init__`)
- Private Attributes (Encapsulation)
- Getters and Setters
- Instance Methods (e.g., `deposit_value`, `show_info`)
- Data Validation (e.g., preventing negative balances)

### Concepts to be studied and applied in the future:
- Inheritance (creating subclasses that inherit attributes and methods)
- Polymorphism (same methods behaving differently in subclasses)
- Magic Methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, etc.)
- Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods
- Composition (using objects of other classes as attributes)
- Design Patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory)
